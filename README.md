bashwatch
=========

The 'watch' command, implemented in Bash for portability (e.g. to Mac OS X).  Tries to present a nice interface, in that it will automatically size its header to fit the width of your terminal.

Note that it doesn't support any of the options that watch does; to the extent it does (e.g. for --interval), it's accomplished via environment variables.  Feel free to improve this.
